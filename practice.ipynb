       "\"KEY INVESTOR INFORMATION\\nThis document provides you with key investor information about this Fund. It is not marketing material. The \\ninformation is required by law to help you understand the nature and risks of investing in this Fund. You are advised \\nto read it so you can make an informed decision about whether to invest.\\n\\nClass Flexible Accumulating EUR Hedged\\nISIN: IE00BJLMKK76\\nManager: BlackRock Asset Management Ireland Limited\\n\\niShares Europe ex-UK Index Fund (IE)\\nA sub-fund of BlackRock Index Selection Fund\\nObjectives and Investment Policy\\nThe Fund aims to achieve a return on your investment, through a combination of capital growth and income on the Fund’s assets, which reflects the return of the \\nequity market in Europe, apart from the United Kingdom.\\nThe Fund invests in equity securities (e.g. shares) listed and traded on regulated markets in Europe excluding the United Kingdom.\\nThe return of the Fund will be compared with the return on an index which will initially be the MSCI Europe ex-UK Index (with net dividends), the Fund’s benchmark \\nindex.\\nThe benchmark index measures the performance of equity securities of leading companies listed in continental Europe and in Ireland. The components of the \\nbenchmark index are weighted by market capitalisation. Market capitalisation, in this case, is the share price of the company multiplied by the number of shares \\nreadily available in the market.\\nThe Fund intends to replicate the benchmark index by holding the equity securities, which make up the benchmark index, in similar proportions to it.\\nThe Fund may also engage in short-term secured lending of its investments to certain eligible third parties. This is used as a means of generating additional income and \\nto off-set the costs of the Fund.\\nRecommendation: This Fund may not be appropriate for short-term investment.\\nYour units will be accumulating units (i.e. dividend income will be included in their value).\\nYour units will be denominated in Euro, the Fund's base currency.\\nYour units will be “hedged” with the aim of reducing the effect of exchange rate fluctuations between their denominated currency and the Fund’s underlying portfolio \\ncurrencies. The hedging strategy may not completely eliminate currency risk and, therefore, may affect the performance of your shares.\\nYou can buy and sell your units daily. The minimum initial investment for this unit class is €1,000,000.\\n\\nFor more information on the Fund, share/unit classes, risks and charges, please see the Fund's prospectus, available on the product pages at www.blackrock.com\\nRisk and Reward Profile\\nLower risk\\nTypically lower rewards\\n\\n- The value of equities and equity-related securities can be affected by daily \\n\\nHigher risk\\nTypically higher rewards\\n\\nstock market movements. Other influential factors include political, economic \\nnews, company earnings and significant corporate events.\\n\\nParticular risks not adequately captured by the risk indicator include:\\n- Counterparty Risk: The insolvency of any institutions providing services such \\n\\nas safekeeping of assets or acting as counterparty to derivatives or other \\ninstruments, may expose the Fund to financial loss.\\n\\nThe risk indicator was calculated incorporating simulated historical data and \\nmay not be a reliable indication of the future risk profile of the Fund.\\nThe risk category shown is not guaranteed and may change over time.\\nThe lowest category does not mean risk free.\\nThe Fund is rated five due to the nature of its investments which include the \\nrisks listed below. These factors may impact the value of the Fund’s investments \\nor expose the Fund to losses.\\n\\n\\x0cCharges\\nThe charges are used to pay the costs of running the Fund, including the costs of \\nmarketing and distributing it. These charges reduce the potential growth of your \\ninvestment.\\nThe entry and exit charges shown are maximum figures. In some cases you might \\npay less. Please refer to your financial advisor or the distributor for the actual entry \\nand exit charges.\\nThe ongoing charges figure shown here is an estimate of the annualised charges. An \\nestimate is being used because the Fund (or unit class) was newly launched or it has \\nbeen launched within the reported period. The Fund's annual report for each \\nfinancial year will include detail on the exact charges made.\\n\\n** (i) To the extent the Fund undertakes securities lending to reduce costs, the\\nFund will receive 62.5% of the associated revenue generated and the remaining\\n37.5%  will  be  received  by  BlackRock  as  the  securities  lending  agent.  As\\nsecurities lending revenue sharing does not increase the costs of running the\\nFund, this has been excluded from the ongoing charges. (ii) Holders in this unit\\nclass may be subject to additional periodic charges outside of the Fund by way\\nof separate agreement with BlackRock.\\nOne-off charges taken before or after you invest\\nEntry Charge\\nExit Charge\\nThis is the maximum that might be taken out of your money before it is invested or \\nbefore proceeds of your investments are paid out.\\nCharges taken from the Fund over each year\\nOngoing Charges\\nCharges taken from the Fund under certain conditions\\nPerformance Fee\\n\\n0.03%**\\n\\nNone\\n\\nNone\\nNone\\n\\nPast Performance\\nPast performance is not a guide to future \\nperformance.\\nThe Fund was launched in 1998.
